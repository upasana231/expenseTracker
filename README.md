Technologies Used

    CSS: Basic styles for the app (colors, table styling, buttons).
    JavaScript: Handles the main logic for adding, editing, deleting, sorting, and filtering expenses.

How It Works
Expense Addition:

    When an expense is added, it's stored temporarily within the current session (no persistent storage).
    The expense data includes the category, amount, and date of the expense.

Expense Editing:

    Editing an expense is done by clicking the "Edit" button. The existing expense is removed, and the fields are pre-populated for updating.

Expense Deletion:

    Deleting an expense removes the corresponding row from the expense list.

Sorting:

    Clicking on "Sort by Amount" will toggle between ascending and descending order based on the expense amount.
    Clicking on "Sort by Date" will toggle between ascending and descending order based on the expense date.

Date Filtering:

    Users can filter expenses by specifying a start date and end date. Only expenses that fall within this range are shown.

Requirements
This application runs entirely in the browser and requires no backend or database. It stores data temporarily in the current session.
